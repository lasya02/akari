# Akari

Akari is an old-school logic puzzle game. It's built on an 8x8 board filled with three different types of cells - ClUE, WALL, and CORRIDOR. The goal is to illuminate every CORRIDOR cell by strategically placing lightbulbs along the board. In addition to illuminating all of the CORRIDOR cells, the CLUE cells must also be satisfied. For example, a CLUE cell with the number 3 must have exactly 3 lightbulbs placed directly next to the cell. 

Here is a website with additional information and some examples of AKARI games - https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/ 

This project is recreating this Japanese light-up puzzle in Swift. It uses the MVVM design pattern.
